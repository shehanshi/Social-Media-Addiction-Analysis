## Project Process
✅ Collected data on students' social media usage, sleeping hours, and education levels.

🧹 Cleaned and organized the dataset using Excel (handled missing or inconsistent values).

📥 Imported the dataset into Tableau for analysis.

📊 Designed an interactive dashboard showing:

          1.Total addicted students
          
          2.Most used social media platform
          
          3.Average sleep hours
          
          4.Addiction by education level
          
📌 Created KPIs to measure usage patterns and addiction impact.

📝 Wrote a blog article (“How to Avoid Social Media Addiction”) and linked it to the dashboard.

💾 Captured dashboard screenshots for preview and sharing.

🌐 Uploaded all project files (dashboard, dataset, images, README) to GitHub.
